# AugmentedReality

This repo contains a script that projects the American flag onto a wall that contains markers. This is a simple example of how augmented reality works. The project can be implemented on your own by cloning this repo, going into this directory and running "python script.py" from the command line.

NOTE: The filepaths are all relative, so be sure to keep the "wall.mp4" and "flag.png" files in the same directory as "script.py".
